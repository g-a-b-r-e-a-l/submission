This is the anonymised code for the ML4PS submission. It contains the folders:

- 'SoDaDE' - the pretraining and validation code for the 'SoDaDE' code
- 'catechol_solvent_selection' - the results of testing the pretrained SoDaDE model on the Catechol Benchmark

Each folder is a repository containing it's own README and requirements. It is recommended that you set your working directory to the folder which contains each repository.
